# Spotify Streaming & Playlist Strategy Insights

This project explores the impact of **playlist and chart placement** on song streaming performance using 2023 Spotify data.

### 🔍 Key Questions Explored
- Do playlist/chart placements significantly boost streams?
- How does exposure on multiple platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Shazam) affect popularity?
- Are there common patterns across highly streamed tracks?

### 📈 Key Insights
- **Songs featured on playlists and charts consistently outperform those that are not.**
- **Cross-platform visibility (2–3 platforms) compounds streaming success.**
- **Distribution analysis shows that playlist presence raises both median performance and consistency.**

### 📊 Visualizations
- Boxplots comparing streams for songs on/off playlists
- Count & distribution plots showing playlist reach vs engagement
- Stream performance vs number of platform placements
